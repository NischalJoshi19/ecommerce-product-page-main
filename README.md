## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned
I got to learn a lot while working on the project. The placement of the menu, the lightbox display, the cart - I started working on the project thinking I don't know how to do this. This project involves a lot of CSS trickery and JS. So many different features to implement first overwhelmed me. However, as I started, things started getting sorted out. It has been a really good project to practice my layout, positioning and js skills.
